# Tabletop Exercise: Phantom Credentials – Initial Access & Pivoting Drill

This tabletop cybersecurity exercise simulates a credential theft and lateral movement attack within a professional services organization. Participants will respond to a simulated phishing attack, investigate suspicious activity, and coordinate incident response actions.

## 🎯 Scenario Summary

A phishing email compromises a user's VPN credentials. The attacker leverages the credentials to gain access to internal systems and escalates privileges using Active Directory tools.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Test and validate incident response procedures
- Enhance team coordination and communication
- Identify gaps in security tools and policies

## 📁 Contents

- `phantom-credentials.md`: Complete exercise scenario and flow
- `artifacts/`: Placeholder for injects, logs, emails (coming soon)
- `instructions.md`: (Optional) Guide for facilitators and observers

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Review the scenario and timeline in `phantom-credentials.md`
2. Use logs, emails, or fake alerts from `artifacts/` (if added)
3. Assign roles and walk through each phase
4. Conduct a debrief using provided reflection questions

## 📎 Reference
